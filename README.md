## About My Web Portfolio

1. **Planning and Design:** I started by outlining the structure of the website, including sections such as navigation, photo gallery, about me and contact. I also designed my website logo. Then I searched for the parts of the site I wanted to use with Bootstrap.

2. **Content and Styling:** For the carousel and photo gallery sections, I added my own photos and images. I also customised the colour scheme using CSS variables to give the site a unique look.

3. **Challenges and Solutions:** I have encountered a problem with the "Contact Me" section, I wanted to use the image overlay layout for the card components, but it is difficult to position the overlay information. I solved the problem by changing the size of the background image. I also made the div that wraps around the message a flexbox so that I can centre the message.

4. **Lessons Learned:** I learned that using Bootstrap to style the website is much more efficient than just using CSS, the key is to find the right class. I also learned the importance of mobile-first design and thorough testing.

## Conclusion

The creation of my web portfolio has been an enriching experience that has deepened my understanding of web design, front-end development and the use of bootstrap to achieve the best result and user experience.
